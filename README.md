Mobile Responsive Portfolio

With this assignment I worked on setting up my mobile response portfolio. I do not have much of a portfolio yet so I decided to replace the "portfolio" section with "hobbies" which are some things I really enjoy doing. Eventually when I am able to build my portfolio and establish a proper linkedIn. I will be able to come back and use this project as a foundation to creating an awesome portfolio. 

I enjoyed this project. It took me a while but that was because I was breaking and adding code to see what would happen.
